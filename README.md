The program asks the user to enter an employee name, hours worked and hourly rate. 

A function receives the name of the employee, the hours worked and the hourly rate. 

It then calculates the pay. 

The function needs to implement a conditional statement to check if the employee worked overtime. 

If so, the employee should get paid time and a half for each hour above 40. 

For instance, if the employee worked 42 hours, and the hourly rate is 10, then 40 * 10 would the pay for regular hours, and 2 * 10 * 1.5. 

The regular pay would be $400 plus an overtime of $30.
